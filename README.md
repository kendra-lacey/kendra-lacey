 Attention to detail is really important in banking, being able to make great espresso is important as a barista.

<h2 align='center'>About Me:</h2>
<p>
 When I'm not writing code I enjoy hiking,swimming,snowboarding,snuggling my cat Debbie,playing portal and thinking of comedy bits. <br> 
 When thinking about what to build I approach the thought process with : What is a problem I or others around me face? Could I write software that could potentially be a solution ?  <br>
 In my pinned repos below you can find a few of those.<br>
 I am interested In collabarting with Indivuals that are passionate about what they are building.
