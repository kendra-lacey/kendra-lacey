# Hi I'm Kendra 
## I'm a Software Engineer located in Upstate NY.<br>
 Pivoting from life as a retail banking maven & Barista. I want to write software and make the world a bit better. üåé<br>
 Attention to detail is really important in banking, being able to make great espresso is important as a barista. 
 Attention to detail ü§ù Caffeine flowing through me .. a match made for writing code.


#
 When I'm not writing code I enjoy hiking,swimming,snowboarding,snuggling my cat Debbie,playing portal and thinking of comedy bits. <br> 
 When thinking about what to build I approach the thought process with : What is a problem I or others around me face? Could I write software that could potentially be a solution ?  <br>
 In my pinned repos below you can find a few of those.<br>
 I am interested In collabarting with Indivuals that are passionate about what they are building.
